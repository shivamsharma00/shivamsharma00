- 👋 Hi, My name is Shivam Sharma.
- I am a student of Arizona State University and enrolled in Robotics and Autonomous System (Artificial Intelligence).
- 👀 I’m big AI geek and like to updated with current science advancements.
- 🌱 Apart from this, when I am away from my system, most probably I am watering my plants.
- 💞️ I’m always up for interesting ideas, projects or chit chat on science.
